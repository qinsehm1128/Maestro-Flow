> Most AI coding tools let you run one agent on one task.
> Maestro-Flow orchestrates **multiple agents across an entire development lifecycle** — from brainstorming to deployment — with an adaptive decision engine, a self-reinforcing knowledge graph, and a real-time visual dashboard.

<br/>

## Two Pillars

Maestro-Flow is built on two interconnected systems that reinforce each other:

                        │          │  knowledge   │            │
                        │          │  injection   │            │

                        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Workflows generate knowledge. Knowledge improves future workflows.** Agents learn from each session, persist discoveries as specs and knowhow, and future agents automatically receive that context through hook injection — creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g maestro-flow
maestro install
```

**Prerequisites**: Node.js ≥ 18, Claude Code CLI. Optional: Codex CLI, agy (Antigravity) CLI for multi-agent workflows.

`maestro install` provides an interactive component selector — choose which assets (commands, hooks, MCP, agents) to install. Use `maestro workspace link` to share knowledge (specs, knowhow, domain) across multiple projects.

---

## Quick Start

### The Ralph Engine

**`/maestro-ralph`** is the primary entry point — a closed-loop lifecycle engine that reads project state, infers your position in the development lifecycle, and builds an adaptive command chain:

```bash
/maestro-ralph "implement OAuth2 authentication with refresh tokens"
```

Ralph automatically determines where you are (brainstorm → plan → execute → verify → review → test → milestone) and builds the appropriate chain. Decision nodes at key checkpoints evaluate results and dynamically insert debug → fix → retry loops when needed.

```bash
/maestro-ralph status              # View session progress
/maestro-ralph continue            # Resume after decision pause
/maestro-ralph -y "build a REST API"  # Full auto — no pauses
```

### Other Entry Points

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/maestro "..."` | Describe intent, let AI route to the optimal command chain |
| `/maestro-quick` | Quick fixes, small features (analyze → plan → execute) |
| `/maestro-*` | Step-by-step: brainstorm, blueprint, analyze, plan, execute, verify |

### Knowledge Management

```bash
# Search across wiki + code (BM25F ranking)
maestro search "user authentication"

# Load specific knowledge types
maestro load --type spec --category coding
maestro load --type knowhow --list

# Explore codebase via API endpoints
maestro explore "Find all database query patterns"

# Manage domain terminology
maestro domain add "API Gateway" "Unified entry point for all API requests"
```

### Odyssey — Long-Running Iterative Cycles

Odyssey commands run extended, self-correcting loops that combine archaeology, diagnosis, fix, verification, and knowledge persistence until acceptance criteria are met:

| Command | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| `odyssey-debug` | Debug cycle — archaeology, diagnosis, fix, confirmation, generalization |
| `odyssey-planex` | Requirement-driven cycle — plan, execute, strict verify, fix loop |
| `odyssey-improve` | Codebase improvement — multi-dimensional audit, targeted fix, verify |
| `odyssey-review-test-fix` | Deep review + fix — multi-dimensional review, targeted fix, generalization |
| `odyssey-ui` | UI optimization — visual survey, audit, divergent exploration, fix |

---

## Workflow Orchestration

### Adaptive Lifecycle Engine

Ralph is an 11-state finite state machine that **decides** but never executes. It reads project state, infers lifecycle position, builds a command chain with quality gates, and hands off execution to `maestro-ralph-execute`. At each decision node (`◆`), Ralph evaluates actual results and decides: proceed, or insert a debug → fix → retry loop.

```
brainstorm → blueprint(opt) → init → analyze(macro) → roadmap(opt) → analyze(micro) → plan → execute → verify
                                                                                                 ◆ decision
                                              review ─── ◆ ─── test ─── ◆ ─── milestone-audit → milestone-complete
                                                                                                 ◆ → next milestone
```

**Three quality modes** control thoroughness:

| Mode | Pipeline | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `full` | verify → business-test → review → test-gen → test | Production, security-critical |
| `standard` | verify → review → test | Default, balanced |
| `quick` | verify → CLI-review | Prototyping, quick fixes |

### Intent-Driven Routing

You don't write pipeline YAML. You describe intent in natural language, and Maestro classifies it into one of **40+ chain types**, each a pre-composed sequence of commands. The same intent produces different chains depending on project state:

```bash
/maestro "add user profile page"
# → New project:     brainstorm → blueprint → analyze → plan → execute → verify
# → Existing project: analyze → plan → execute → verify
# → Quick fix:       plan → execute → verify
```

### Layered Command Topology

Commands are organized in four layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Commands |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Origin** | Diverge ideas, converge direction | brainstorm, blueprint |
| **Understanding** | Explore scope (macro) + deep-dive (micro) | analyze (dual-mode) |
| **Orchestration** | Structure into milestones and phases | roadmap |
| **Execution** | Plan, implement, verify | plan, execute, verify, review, test |

Six canonical paths (A–F) cover everything from full greenfield projects to single-line fixes.

### Multi-Agent Dispatch

Maestro coordinates **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, and OpenCode** through four composable orchestration patterns:

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Delegate** | Dispatch to any CLI tool via `maestro delegate` with SQLite-backed job broker, async execution, and message injection for follow-up chaining |
| **Team** | Coordinator-worker architecture — coordinators generate role-specs, spawn `team-worker` agents in parallel, supervised by a resident quality observer |
| **Wave** | Topological sort of tasks into dependency waves; independent tasks run concurrently within each wave |
| **Swarm** | ACO-driven multi-agent exploration for complex problem spaces with pheromone-guided convergence |

These patterns compose: a team coordinator can delegate subtasks to different LLM backends, wave execution parallelizes independent work, and the dashboard provides a real-time supervisory control loop — all sharing the broker and message bus as coordination primitives.

---

## Knowledge System

### Knowledge Graph (MaestroGraph)

**MaestroGraph** is the unified code index engine that replaces the former CodeGraph dependency. Built on `web-tree-sitter` for AST-level extraction, it stores both **code structure** (functions, classes, call chains) and **project knowledge** (specs, knowhow, domain terms, issues) in a single SQLite-backed graph with dual FTS5 indexes.

```bash
maestro kg search <symbol>        # Find nodes
maestro kg context <node>         # Get surrounding context
maestro kg callers <function>     # Trace call chains
maestro kg callees <function>     # Trace dependencies
```

### Spec Injection

Project rules (coding standards, architecture constraints, quality criteria) are stored as `<spec-entry>` blocks with keyword tags. **Hooks automatically inject relevant specs into every agent prompt** based on keyword matching — agents receive project-specific rules without explicit loading.

### Self-Reinforcing Learning Loop

```
Agent executes task
    → Discovers pattern/pitfall/decision
    → Persists as spec entry or knowhow doc
    → Hook system indexes new knowledge
    → Future agents auto-receive via prompt injection
    → Better execution → more discoveries → ...
```

Four learning tools feed this cycle: `learn-retro` (retrospective), `learn-follow` (pattern study), `learn-decompose` (architecture breakdown), `learn-investigate` (deep dive).

### Domain Knowledge

A semantic glossary layer that defines **what things mean** in your project. Domain terms (`maestro domain`) standardize terminology, map concept relationships, and serve as a MaestroGraph knowledge source — bridging the gap between code-level symbols and business-level concepts.

### Wiki & Search

WikiIndexer walks the `.workflow/` directory, parses frontmatter, builds backlink graphs, and creates a **BM25 inverted index** for full-text search across all project knowledge — specs, knowhow, issues, and KG nodes as virtual entries.

---

## Issue Closed-Loop

Issues aren't just tickets. They're a self-healing pipeline:

```
discover → analyze → plan → execute → close
    ▲                                    │
    └────── quality commands auto-create ─┘
```

Quality commands (review, test, verify) automatically create issues for problems they find. Issue fixes flow back into the phase pipeline.

---

## Visual Dashboard

Real-time dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3001` — Kanban board, Gantt timeline, sortable table, and command center. Pick an agent on any issue card and dispatch.

```bash
maestro serve                  # Launch web dashboard
maestro view                   # Terminal TUI alternative
maestro command-help           # Interactive command reference (alias: ch)
```

Built with React 19, Zustand, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, Hono, WebSocket.
