<purpose>
Orchestrate impeccable skill commands via intelligent intent routing + quality gate auto-iteration.
Chain: Build → Evaluate → Auto-Refine → Re-evaluate → Verify.

Core innovation: critique/audit scores drive automatic command selection and iteration loops.
Impeccable has 23 commands across 6 categories — this command chains them into automated pipelines
with quality gates that loop until design quality meets the threshold.

Prerequisite: impeccable skill available (auto-discovered by harness).
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — intent description or target path, with optional flags.

**Flags:**
- `--chain <type>` — Force chain type: build, improve, enhance, harden, live
- `--enhance <cmd>` — Specific enhance command for enhance chain (animate|colorize|typeset|layout|delight|overdrive|bolder)
- `--threshold <score>` — Critique pass threshold (default: 26/40). Audit threshold auto-computed as threshold×0.5
- `--max-loops <n>` — Maximum quality gate iterations (default: 3)
- `-y` — Auto mode: auto-select at ambiguous routing, skip confirmations where impeccable allows
</context>

<chains>

### Chain Definitions

| Chain | Sequence | Gate Condition |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **build** | teach? → shape → craft → **critique** → [refine loop] → audit → polish | critique ≥ threshold AND P0 == 0 |
| **improve** | **critique** → [refine loop] → polish → audit | critique ≥ threshold AND P0 == 0 |
| **enhance** | {cmd} → **critique** → polish (if needed) | critique ≥ threshold |
| **harden** | harden → **audit** → polish | audit ≥ threshold×0.5 |
| **live** | live | — (interactive, no gate) |

- `teach?` — conditional: only if PRODUCT.md missing/placeholder
- `[refine loop]` — quality gate loop: extract suggested commands from critique → execute → re-critique

### Intent → Chain Routing

| Intent Pattern | Chain |
|---------------|-------|
| 新建, create, build, new, 从零, landing, feature, page | build |
| 改进, improve, fix, 优化, iterate, better, 迭代 | improve |
| 动画, 颜色, 排版, animate, color, type, bold, delight, enhance | enhance |
| 生产, production, harden, 上线, ship, edge case, i18n | harden |
| 实时, live, browser, 浏览器, variant | live |

Explicit `--chain` overrides routing. Ambiguous + no `-y` → AskUserQuestion.

</transitions>

<actions>

### A_LOAD_CONTEXT

1. Trigger impeccable context loading by invoking: `Skill({ skill: "impeccable", args: "teach" })`
   - Impeccable's own setup will auto-discover and load PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md
   - If PRODUCT.md missing/placeholder, impeccable teach handles the interview
2. If teach was not in the chain but PRODUCT.md is missing:
   - Prepend `teach` to chain start
   - Announce: W001
3. Context is now in conversation for subsequent commands

### A_FINAL_REPORT

1. Read critique trend if available (impeccable's critique persists snapshots automatically)
2. Present summary table with scores, iterations, commands executed

</actions>

</state_machine>

<execution>

## 1. Detect Impeccable

Check if "impeccable" appears in the system's available skill list (auto-discovered by harness).
The skill list is provided in `<system-reminder>` tags — search for `impeccable` in the skill descriptions.

```
"impeccable" in available skills?
  Yes → continue
  No  → E001: "impeccable skill 未安装。请先在目标项目中安装 impeccable。"
```

## 2. Parse & Route

1. If `--chain` present → use directly
2. Otherwise → match $ARGUMENTS against intent patterns
3. If `--enhance` present → chain = enhance, cmd = --enhance value
4. For enhance chain without `--enhance` → infer from intent ("动画" → animate, "颜色" → colorize, etc.)
5. Ambiguous + no `-y` → ask user to pick chain

Create TodoWrite with chain steps.

## 3. Setup Context

1. If chain starts with `teach` → execute it first, impeccable handles context loading internally
2. Otherwise → invoke `Skill({ skill: "impeccable" })` with no args to trigger setup (context + register)
3. If impeccable reports PRODUCT.md missing → prepend teach, execute, then resume

## 4. Execute Chain

For each step in chain, sequentially:

```
▸ Step {n}/{total}: /impeccable {command} {target}
```

Execute via: `Skill({ skill: "impeccable", args: "{command} {target}" })`

**Rules:**
- `teach`, `shape`, `craft` are interactive — do NOT suppress their user gates
- After `teach` completes → re-run context loader for fresh PRODUCT.md
- After `craft` completes → the build exists, ready for evaluation
- Gate steps (critique/audit) → transition to quality gate logic

## 5. Quality Gate

When chain reaches a gate step (critique or audit):

### 5a. Execute Gate Command

```
Skill({ skill: "impeccable", args: "critique {target}" })
```
or
```
Skill({ skill: "impeccable", args: "audit {target}" })
```

### 5b. Parse Score

From critique output, extract:
- **score**: Nielsen's total (N/40) — from "**Total** | | **N/40**" row
- **P0_count**: count of `[P0]` tagged findings
- **P1_count**: count of `[P1]` tagged findings
- **suggested_commands**: list of "/impeccable <cmd>" from "Suggested command" fields

From audit output, extract:
- **score**: dimension total (N/20) — from "**Total** | | **N/20**" row
- **P0_count**: count of `[P0]` findings

### 5c. Evaluate

```
critique_pass = (score >= threshold) AND (P0_count == 0)
audit_pass    = (score >= threshold * 0.5) AND (P0_count == 0)
```

### 5d. On PASS

```
✓ Gate passed: {score}/{max} (P0: 0)
```
→ advance to next chain step

### 5e. On FAIL

```
⟳ Loop {n}/{max_loops}: {score}/{max}, P0={count}
  Running: {command_list}
```

1. Collect suggested commands from P0/P1 findings
2. If no suggestions found → use fallback mapping (see quality_gate_routing)
3. De-duplicate, cap at 3 commands per iteration
4. Sort: P0-suggested first
5. Execute each: `Skill({ skill: "impeccable", args: "{cmd} {target}" })`
   - Pass issue context: the specific findings that triggered this command are already in conversation
6. Re-run gate command (critique/audit)
7. Increment loop_count

### 5f. On Max Loops Exceeded

```
⚠ Max iterations ({max_loops}) reached. Score: {score}/{max}, P0: {count}
  Continuing chain with remaining issues.
```
→ force advance to next chain step

## 6. Final Report

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Chain complete: {chain_type}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 Critique : {score}/40 (trend: {trend_line})
 Audit    : {score}/20
 Loops    : {total_iterations}
 Commands : {executed_command_list}

 Status   : {PASS | PARTIAL — N issues remain}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If issues remain → suggest: "Run `/maestro-ui-craft --chain improve {target}` to continue iteration."

### Finding → Command Fallback Mapping

When critique/audit findings lack explicit "Suggested command", map by category:

| Finding Category | Command |
|-----------------|---------|
| Visual hierarchy, layout, spacing, alignment | layout |
| Color, contrast, palette, monochromatic | colorize |
| Typography, font, readability, hierarchy | typeset |
| Animation, motion, transitions, micro-interaction | animate |
| Copy, labels, error messages, UX writing | clarify |
| Responsive, mobile, breakpoints, touch targets | adapt |
| Performance, loading, speed, bundle, jank | optimize |
| Complexity, overload, clutter, cognitive load | distill |
| Bland, safe, generic, lacks personality | bolder |
| Aggressive, overwhelming, loud, overstimulating | quieter |
| Onboarding, empty state, first-run, activation | onboard |
| Edge cases, i18n, error handling, overflow | harden |
| Personality, memorability, joy, delight | delight |

### Commands Never Auto-Selected

These are structural/interactive — never picked by the refine loop:

| Command | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| teach | Project setup (run in S_SETUP only) |
| shape | Requires user interview |
| craft | Full build with multiple gates |
| live | Interactive browser mode |
| document | Generates DESIGN.md (setup) |
| extract | Design system extraction (setup) |
| overdrive | Requires explicit user vision |
| critique | Gate command, not a fix |
| audit | Gate command, not a fix |
