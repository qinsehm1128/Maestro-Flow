<purpose>
Wave-based multi-role brainstorming via `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Diamond topology:
Wave 1 (guidance spec) → Wave 2 (parallel role analysis, 3-9 agents) → Wave 3 (cross-role review + resolution writeback).
Wave 2 agents produce multi-file analysis per role under `{role}/` (analysis.md index + per-feature files + findings).
Wave 3 compares Decision Digests from each role's `analysis.md` §2 and patches the role files. Audit trail appended to `guidance-specification.md` §12.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — topic text and optional flags.

**Flags**: `-y` (auto), `-c N` (concurrency, default 6), `--continue` (resume), `--count N` (roles, default 3 max 9), `--skip-questions`, `--review-only` (skip Wave 1/2; run Wave 3 only against existing */analysis.md)

**9 valid roles**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert

### Pre-load specs
1. **Architecture specs**: `maestro spec load --category arch` — load architecture constraints as context for multi-role design (roles respect documented decisions).
2. **Role Knowledge**: `maestro wiki list --category arch` → identify relevant entries → `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2...]`
3. Both optional — proceed without if unavailable.

**Session**: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-brainstorm-{slug}/`

**Output** (per session):
- `guidance-specification.md` — machine contract (Wave 1; consumed by downstream roadmap/analyze/spec-generate). §11 Decision Tracking, §12 Cross-Role Resolutions.
- `design-research.md` — optional, external research from Wave 1
- `{role}/analysis.md` — index + Decision Digest + cross-cutting foundations per selected role (Wave 2)
- `{role}/analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md` — per-feature analysis files (Wave 2)
- `{role}/findings-{slug}.md` — additional discoveries (Wave 2, optional)
- `context-package.json` — standardized context contract (context-package/1.0 schema) for downstream commands
- `tasks.csv`, `results.csv`, `discoveries.ndjson`, `context.md` — wave-engine bookkeeping
</context>

Wave 1: 1 guidance row. Wave 2: N role rows (parallel) — each writes `{role}/analysis.md` + `{role}/analysis-F-*.md` + `{role}/findings-*.md`. Wave 3: 1 reviewer row (reads analysis.md §2 Decision Digests; emits structured findings consumed by orchestrator).
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Wave order sacred**: Guidance (W1) MUST complete before role design (W2); review (W3) MUST run only after all W2 rows complete.
2. **CSV source of truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state.
3. **Discovery board append-only**: Never modify/delete discoveries.ndjson.
4. **Skip on failure**: Guidance fails → abort. All W2 roles fail → skip review.
5. **9 valid roles only**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert
6. **Wave 3 is read-only at the agent boundary**: the reviewer emits structured findings (conflicts / gaps / synergies with `patch_targets[]`). The orchestrator (not the agent) applies the patches via Edit.
7. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous until all waves complete; only pause at [CHECKPOINT] (skipped with -y).

### Wave agent responsibilities

**Guidance (W1, agent role `guidance-generator`)**: Analyze topic → extract 5-10 terms → define non-goals → decompose features (max 8, F-{3digit}) → RFC 2119 keywords → write `guidance-specification.md` with §1-§12 (§11 Decision Tracking, §12 Cross-Role Resolutions initially empty — populated later by S_RESOLVE).

**Role Analysis (W2, agent role = the role name itself)**: Read guidance-spec → produce multi-file analysis under `{role}/`:
- `analysis.md` — INDEX with §1 Role Mandate (≤ 200 words), §2 Decision Digest (4 tables: Decisions, Interfaces, Cross-Cutting Positions, Findings Summary), §3 Cross-Cutting Foundations, §4 File Index, §5 Outstanding TODOs
- `analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md` — one per feature (< 2000 words each)
- `findings-{slug}.md` — additional discoveries (0 or more, < 1000 words)

system-architect MUST include in §3: Data Model, State Machine, Error Handling, Observability, Configuration, Boundary Scenarios.

The agent MUST write files. The agent MUST NOT return analysis as text.

**Cross-Role Review (W3, agent role `cross-role-reviewer`)**: Read ALL `{role}/analysis.md` files (§2 Decision Digests) + guidance-specification.md → emit structured report (NOT files):

```
## Conflicts (need user decision)
### C-001: ...
  patch_targets:
    - target_file: {role-A}/analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md   # or {role-A}/analysis.md for cross-cutting
      target_heading: ## {exact heading text}
      edit_type: annotate_and_strikeout
      edit_content: > **Cross-Role Resolution (C-001)**: {1-line resolution}
    - target_file: {role-B}/analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md
      target_heading: ## {exact heading text}
      edit_type: annotate_and_strikeout

## Gaps
### G-001: ...
  patch_targets:
    - target_file: {ref-role}/analysis.md   edit_type: annotate_after_heading   # §2 Interfaces table
    - target_file: {owner-role}/analysis.md edit_type: append_to_section        # §2 Decisions table

## Synergy Opportunities
### S-001: ...
  patch_targets:
    - target_file: {role-A}/analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md edit_type: annotate_after_heading
    - target_file: {role-B}/analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md edit_type: annotate_after_heading

## Summary
conflicts_count / gaps_count / synergies_count / review_confidence
```

`edit_type` vocabulary is closed: `annotate_after_heading` / `annotate_and_strikeout` / `append_to_section`. The orchestrator MUST refuse any patch outside this set.

### A_DESIGN_EXPLORE

When ui-designer is among selected roles, establish visual direction before Wave 2:

1. If `.workflow/impeccable/PRODUCT.md` missing → run `$maestro-impeccable teach`
2. If `.workflow/impeccable/DESIGN.md` missing → run `$maestro-impeccable explore`
3. If both already exist → skip (visual direction already locked)

explore generates multi-style HTML prototypes, visual comparison, user selection/mix, and produces DESIGN.md.
ui-designer agents in Wave 2 then focus on UX/visual design referencing DESIGN.md.

### A_APPLY_RESOLUTIONS

For each finding in `review_findings`:

1. **Confirm with user** (skip if -y): present finding + suggested resolution; user picks `Accept` / `Pick A` / `Pick B` (conflict only) / `Skip` / `Defer to TODO`.
2. **Iterate `patch_targets[]`**: for each target, locate `target_heading` verbatim in `target_file`; apply the edit per `edit_type`.
3. **Heading drift fallback**: if `target_heading` not found verbatim, log W006 and skip that target. Never invent or fuzzy-match headings.
4. **Append audit row** to `guidance-specification.md` §12 "Cross-Role Resolutions":
   ```
   | C-001 | conflict | system-architect/analysis-F-*.md "<heading>" / subject-matter-expert/analysis-F-*.md "<heading>" | {resolution} | both annotated+superseded |
   ```

If zero findings, S_RESOLVE is bypassed and `guidance §12` is unchanged.

### A_AGGREGATE

1. Export results.csv
1.5. Generate context-package.json (extract from guidance-specification.md + {role}/analysis.md §2 Digests → standardized schema per context-package/1.0)
2. Generate context.md (summary, guidance, per-role analyses, review_findings_count, resolutions_applied, patches_skipped, next steps)
3. Confidence scoring: 5 dimensions (role_coverage, cross_role_consistency, feature_completeness, spec_quality, design_feasibility). Quality gate: cross_role_consistency < 0.4 → warn.
4. Copy artifacts to target session directory (preserve `{role}/` subdirs).
5. Next-step routing: DESIGN.md established → `maestro-impeccable build <feature>`; else UI features detected → `maestro-impeccable build <feature>`; else → maestro-analyze / maestro-plan / maestro-roadmap
